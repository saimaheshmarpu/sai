problem 2 
Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. (Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦)
solution 
This program will allow the user to find the nth term of a fibonacci number series
Declare the variables currentterm,nextterm,previousterm,nthterm,i as integers
Ask the user to enter which term they want
Store the number as nthterm

assign that previousterm=0 
assign that currentterm=1
For 
    i=1 to nth term
   assign  nextterm=currentterm+previousterm
	previousterm=currentterm
	currentterm=nextterm
when this loop is done, 
print previous term 
end
this a good way to find the nth term in fibonacci series
