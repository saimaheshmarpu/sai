pseudo code  for problem 1 
Q) Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).
NOTE: You can use ‘%’ operator to separate each digit of the given number(like N % 10)

solution:
1) # finding whether a number is divisible by 3 or not by not using "%" operator 
declare variables n,sum1,rem1, rem2,sum2,r,p
 get  number i.e n (# enter the number for which you want to check whether the number is divisible by 3 or not )
 assign    sum1=0
 assign    r = n  (# assume that r =n)
 while r>0 
          assign that rem1= r%10 (#% means co eficent when numerator was divided by denominator)
         assign that  sum1=sum1+i
         assign that  r=r/10
if 
   sum1==3 or sum1==6 or sum1==9 
   print "given number is divisible by 3"
else if 
         sum1<=9 
         print " given number is not divisible by 3"
else 
      assign that   p=sum1
      assign that sum2=0
while 
       assign that rem2=p%10
       assign  that sum2 = sum2+rem2
       assign that  p=p/10
if 
      sum2==3 or sum2==6 or sum2==9 
   print "given number is divisible by 3"
else 
         print " given number is not divisible by 3"
